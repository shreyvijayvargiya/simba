# Analytics

This guide covers all analytics integrations available in the SAAS Starter boilerplate, including PostHog for session replays and product analytics, Vercel Analytics for web performance metrics, and custom analytics for visitor tracking.

## PostHog Analytics

PostHog is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides session replays, event tracking, feature flags, and user insights.

### Installation

1. **Install the PostHog package:**

```bash
npm install posthog-js
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

### Getting Your PostHog API Key

1. Sign up for a free account at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Project API Key**
4. Copy your API key (starts with `phc_`)
5. Add it to your `.env.local` file

**Note:** If you're using PostHog's EU cloud, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com` instead.

### Integration

PostHog is automatically initialized when you wrap your app with `PostHogProvider` in `pages/_app.js`. The integration includes:

- **Automatic page view tracking** on route changes
- **Session replay recording** with privacy settings
- **User identification** on login/signup
- **Custom event tracking** via utility functions

### Using PostHog Methods

#### Track Custom Events

Track custom events throughout your application:

```javascript
import { trackEvent } from "../lib/utils/posthog";

// Track a button click
trackEvent("button_clicked", {
  button_name: "signup",
  page: "/pricing"
});

// Track a purchase
trackEvent("purchase_completed", {
  amount: 99.99,
  currency: "USD",
  product_id: "premium_plan"
});
```

#### Identify Users

Identify users when they log in or sign up:

```javascript
import { identifyUser } from "../lib/utils/posthog";

// Identify user after authentication
identifyUser(user.uid, {
  email: user.email,
  name: user.displayName,
  plan: "premium"
});
```

#### Set User Properties

Update user properties:

```javascript
import { setUserProperties } from "../lib/utils/posthog";

setUserProperties({
  subscription_tier: "pro",
  last_active: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

#### Reset User (on Logout)

Reset user identification when logging out:

```javascript
import { resetUser } from "../lib/utils/posthog";

// Call on logout
resetUser();
```

#### Feature Flags

Check feature flag values:

```javascript
import { getFeatureFlag } from "../lib/utils/posthog";

const isNewFeatureEnabled = getFeatureFlag("new-feature", false);

if (isNewFeatureEnabled) {
  // Show new feature
}
```

#### Session Replay Controls

Manually control session replay:

```javascript
import { 
  startSessionReplay, 
  stopSessionReplay, 
  isSessionReplayActive 
} from "../lib/utils/posthog";

// Start recording
startSessionReplay();

// Stop recording
stopSessionReplay();

// Check if active
const isActive = isSessionReplayActive();
```

## Custom Analytics

The SAAS Starter includes a custom analytics system that tracks visitors using browser fingerprinting and IP geolocation. This data is stored in Firebase and displayed in the admin dashboard.

### API Overview

The custom analytics API is located in `lib/api/analytics.js` and provides the following methods:

#### Track Analytics

Automatically tracks visitors on app load (runs once per session):

```javascript
import { trackAnalytics } from "../lib/api/analytics";

// Called automatically by AnalyticsTracker component
trackAnalytics();
```

#### Get All Analytics

Retrieve all analytics records:

```javascript
import { getAllAnalytics } from "../lib/api/analytics";

const analytics = await getAllAnalytics();
// Returns array of analytics records with:
// - fingerprint, userAgent, location data
// - firstVisit, lastVisit, visitCount
```

#### Get Analytics by Fingerprint

Find a specific visitor by fingerprint:

```javascript
import { getAnalyticsByFingerprint } from "../lib/api/analytics";

const visitor = await getAnalyticsByFingerprint(fingerprint);
```

### Data Collected

The custom analytics system collects:

- **Browser fingerprint** (unique identifier)
- **User agent** (browser and device info)
- **IP address** and geolocation (country, city, coordinates)
- **Visit timestamps** (first visit, last visit)
- **Visit count** (number of sessions)

### Viewing Custom Analytics

1. Navigate to your admin dashboard at `/admin`
2. Click on **Analytics** in the sidebar (under "Audience" section)
3. View comprehensive analytics including:
   - **Visitors** and **Page Views** statistics
   - **Geographic distribution** map
   - **Time-based charts** (24h, 7d, 30d)
   - **Country breakdown**
   - **Top pages and referrers**

![Admin Analytics Dashboard](https://b4fcijccdw.ufs.sh/f/mVUSE925dTRYjJ3LEXS6Fu1bQOM0p4lVUeY7JgB8RswZoWSE)

**How to access:**
- Log in to your admin panel
- Navigate to **Audience** → **Analytics**
- View dashboard with visitor metrics, charts, and geographic map
- Switch between Dashboard and Map views
- Filter by time range (24h, 7d, 30d)

### Analytics Component

The analytics tracking is handled automatically by the `AnalyticsTracker` component in `lib/ui/AnalyticsTracker.jsx`, which is integrated into `pages/_app.js`. It tracks visitors once per session using sessionStorage.

## Summary

- **PostHog**: Session replays, event tracking, user insights (requires API key)
- **Vercel Analytics**: Web performance and visitor metrics (automatic on Vercel)
- **Custom Analytics**: Internal visitor tracking with geographic data (admin dashboard)

All three analytics systems work together to provide comprehensive insights into your application's usage and performance.
